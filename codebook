# Tidy Data Project Code Book
# Data sets for 6 activities are provides that measure body forces resulting from 30 participants doing 6 activities

Training and test subject data sets are combined and only mean and standard deviation measurements are retained in the final
data set. 

1. For both the training and data sets extract the subject activity and combine the data. 
2. Extract the variables for the mean and standard deviation only from the 'features.txt' file to use as column headings for 
the data
3. Compute the average value of all mean and standard deviation statistics and save in a separate file.
